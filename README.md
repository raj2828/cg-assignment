The aim of the mini project is to implement visualization of rain water collection. The visualization consists of a house on which rain falls. The water is passed through different components and is thus, reused. The components are implemented using 2D dimensions and flow of water is visualized using 2D animation. Through this project, various stages of rain water collection can be implemented and importance of each stage can be known. Hence, the project can be used as a learning tool for explaining this process
